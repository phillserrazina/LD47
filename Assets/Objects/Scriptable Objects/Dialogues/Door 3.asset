    - Right... I'm still keeping you here... but that was an easy riddle though,
      wasn't it?
    - The last person to come in here wasn't the smartest, so I had to dumb it down
      a bit.
    - They came in on loop 94, I believe. People from the future aren't that bright.
    - They walked all the way to loop 150 to find a hidden treasure or whatever.
      Something about easter?
    - Anyway! Walk back to loop 0, I have a surprise for you!

      the right room.
    - (I'd write down this next bit, if I were you)

    - Come back to this door once you've figured it out. Have fun!!
